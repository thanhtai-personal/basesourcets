# Why Pnpm

There are several reasons why one might consider using pnpm instead of npm:

1. Faster installation: pnpm uses a unique approach called "hard linking" which allows it to consume significantly less disk space and install dependencies faster compared to npm. This can be especially beneficial for larger projects with a lot of dependencies.

2. Efficient disk space usage: pnpm uses a single storage for all the dependencies across projects on a machine. It creates a file system link for each required package rather than creating duplicate copies, which greatly reduces the disk space required for multiple projects.

3. Improved parallelism: pnpm can run multiple installation processes simultaneously, allowing for faster installation times, especially on multi-core systems.

4. Consistent and reproducible builds: pnpm creates a deterministic lockfile that ensures consistent and reproducible builds across different environments. This eliminates the potential for dependency conflicts and ensures that everyone working on the project uses the exact same versions of dependencies.

5. Seamless migration from npm: pnpm is fully compatible with npm and Yarn, making it easy to migrate existing projects without much hassle. It uses the same package.json and node_modules structure, allowing for a smooth transition.

# Why typescript

There are several reasons why TypeScript can be preferred over JavaScript in certain scenarios:

1. Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing for checking and validating types at compile-time. This helps catch potential errors early in the development process, leading to more robust and reliable code.

2. Enhanced Tooling: TypeScript provides excellent tooling support with features like code completion, better refactoring, and navigation. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code offer strong support for TypeScript, improving developer productivity.

3. Improved Code Readability and Maintainability: TypeScript allows developers to explicitly define types for variables, parameters, and return values. This makes the code more self-documenting and easier to understand. Additionally, by enabling features like interfaces and classes, it promotes modular and organized code, enhancing code maintainability.

4. Better IDE Support and Error Detection: The use of static types in TypeScript enables IDEs to provide better autocompletion suggestions and detect errors as you type. This results in a smoother development experience, reducing the need for manual debugging.

5. Robustness and Scalability: TypeScript is designed to build large-scale applications. Its type system reduces the chances of potential bugs and simplifies refactoring. It also supports features such as generics, namespaces, and modules, which aid in building complex applications with better organization and code reuse.

6. Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This allows developers to gradually migrate existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript without having to rewrite everything at once.

# Why mikro-orm

1. Ease of use: MikroORM provides an easy-to-use and intuitive API, which makes it simple to work with the database. It offers a fluent query builder that allows you to write expressive and readable code.

2. Multiple database support: MikroORM supports multiple databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB. This allows you to choose the best database for your application without worrying about changing your ORM.

3. Object-relational mapping: MikroORM provides an efficient object-relational mapping (ORM) system that allows you to work with database entities as regular JavaScript objects. This makes it easier to work with complex data relationships and query the database.

4. Code generation: MikroORM comes with a powerful CLI tool that can generate code for your entities, migrations, and schemas based on your database schema. This saves time and reduces the chance of errors when writing boilerplate code.

5. Performance and optimization: MikroORM is designed to be lightweight and performant. It takes advantage of batch operations and caching to minimize the number of database queries and optimize the overall performance of your application.

6. Community and support: MikroORM has an active community of developers who can provide support, help with troubleshooting, and contribute to the development of the ORM. It also has comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

Overall, MikroORM offers a simplified and powerful way to work with databases in your application, providing a better developer experience and improving productivity.
